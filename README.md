# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival based on features like gender, age, and class.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Seaborn built-in Titanic dataset (`sns.load_dataset("titanic")`)
- Features include: age, sex, class, fare, survived, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis & Insights
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival.
- Younger passengers showed slightly higher survival probabilities.

## 📈 Visuals
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class
- Age distribution
- Correlation heatmaps
